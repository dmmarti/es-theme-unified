# Unified

#####################################################################################

OVERVIEW

This ZIP package contains the Unified theme that is to be used within Emulation Station.

Originally written by CriticalCid as a theme for the Launchbox/BigBox front-end, this is an Emulation Station port of that theme.

This theme supports the starndard three images (image, marque, video) as well as the standard collection menu items (all games, last played, favorites, custom collections).

NOTE

You do not always have to put Emulation Station themes in the standard /etc/emulationstation/themes location.

Emulation Station provides additional support for placing them into a different folder. The benefit of using this different folder is that the default user "pi" has full read/write access. You no longer have to be user "root" to copy over files or swap out files.

By default, this new "themes" folder does not exist, so simply create it.

/opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/themes

NOTE You can also access this same folder by navigating this hidden folder

/home/pi/.emulationstation
